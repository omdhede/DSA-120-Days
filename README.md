Recursive function for same:
When you use recursive function, it runs infinity times. Therefore, there should be a base limit/condition.

# Base Condition in Recursion:
A condition when our recursion will stop making new calls.
It may be simple "if" condition.

No base condition -> function calls will keep happening, stack will be filled again and again.
We know that every call takes memory.
