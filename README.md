# DSA-120-Days

## DAY-6
Beginning from DAY-6 : Patterns
Referring from: Kunal Kushwaha (YouTube)

### How to approach: 
1. no. of rows = no. of lines = no. of times the outer loop will run
2. Identify for every row no. :
   a. How many cols are there
   b. Types of elements in the col
3. What do you need to print

## DAY-7
Beginning from DAY-7 : Recursion.
Referring to the following youtube bootcamp:

Recursive function for same:
When you use recursive function, it runs infinity times. Therefore, there should be a base limit/condition.

### Base Condition in Recursion:
A condition when our recursion will stop making new calls.
It may be simple "if" condition.

No base condition -> function calls will keep happening, stack will be filled again and again.
We know that every call takes memory.
